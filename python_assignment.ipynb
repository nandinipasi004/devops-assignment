        "Ans: function in python: a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.\n",
        "                         functions are used to organize code into manageable pieces ,making it easier to read,understand,\n",
        "                         and maintain.\n",
        "    1)modularity: function allow you to break down a program into smaller parts.each function can perform a specific task,\n",
        "    and you can call the function whenever needed.\n",
        "    2)code reusability: once you define a function,you can use it multiple times in your program without rewriting the same code.\n",
        "    this promotes code reusability.\n",
        "    3)abstraction: functions provide a level of abstraction. when you call a function you don't need to know the internal details of how the function works,\n",
        "    you only need to know what it does.\n",
        "    4)parameter passing: functions can take parameters(input) that can be used inside the function to perform operations.\n",
        "    this allows function to work with different data each time they are called.\n",
        "    5)return statements: functions can return a value as a result of thier computation.this returned value can be used in the rest of the program.\n",
        "    6)organization: functions help in organizing code logically. by grouping related code into functions,you can improve the structure of program.\n",
        "    7)scope: functions have thier own scope, meaning variables defined inside a function are local to that function unless specified otherwise.\n",
        "    this helps in avoiding naming conflicts and maintaining data integrity.\n",
        "    8)function arguments: functions can take both positional and keyword arguments.positional arguments are passed based on thier position,while keyword arguments\n",
        "    are passed with a specific keywords,providing flexibility in function calls.\n",
        "    9)lambda function: python also supports lambda functions,which are small, anonymous functions defined using the 'lambda' keyword.\n",
        "    lambda functions are used for simple operations and are often used in conjunctions with functions like 'map()','reduce()'\n",
        "    10)built-in functions: python comes with a wide range of built-in functions. these functions can be directly used in your code without the need to define them yourself,\n",
